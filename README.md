# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:

To design a refreshing, joyful, and modern digital presence that highlights Aliya’s Frozen Delight as a premium frozen dessert brand. The design will emphasize the provided logo, using its elegant typography and cool tones to create a friendly, indulgent, and recognizable identity across all digital platforms.

## Algorithm:

I. Visual Hierarchy & Structure

Grouping: Place related elements together (e.g., Flavors with prices, Combo Offers with images, Customer Reviews with ratings).

Similarity: Ensure all primary Call-to-Action buttons (e.g., Order Now, Customize Your Sundae) share the same style—consistent colors, rounded edges, and hover/active states.

Flow: Guide users smoothly from the brand introduction (Hero Banner with ice cream visuals) → featured delights (best-sellers, combos) → special offers → final action (Place Order / Subscribe).

II. Platform Specifics
Web:

Hero Section: Display a large, eye-catching image of ice creams, sundaes, or frozen treats in colors that complement the logo. Place the logo prominently in the center or top-left.

Navigation: Use a horizontal menu bar with clear options (Home, Menu, Offers, Order Online, Contact). Highlight the Order Now button.

Content Display: Use a grid layout (e.g., 3-column) for showcasing flavors, toppings, and combo packs with images.

Mobile:

Navigation: Provide a hamburger menu (≡) with quick access to menu items.

Content Display: Use vertical, scrollable cards for desserts with clear images, prices, and “Add to Cart” buttons—optimized for thumb use.

Quick Actions: Floating “Order Now” button for faster access.

III. Interactivity & Consistency

Feel (Interaction): Buttons and images should scale slightly or show a shadow effect when hovered/tapped.

Consistency: Use a pastel/light background inspired by the logo’s color palette, with darker shades for headings and buttons. Maintain the same typography style across headings and subheadings.

Easy to Use: Place key actions (Order Now, Subscribe, Customize) at the top and repeat them at the bottom for smooth navigation.

IV. The Logo

Recognition: The provided Aliya’s Frozen Delight logo, with its bold “AS” initials and stylish text, conveys elegance and premium branding.

Application: The logo will serve as the central identity—used as a favicon, on the top-left corner of the header, as a watermark on product images, and in packaging design for strong brand recall.

## Output:

<img width="1310" height="771" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee7a9ec4-c474-4969-a3dc-a755ab6deeb6" />


## Result:

The basic web and mobile layout for Aliya’s Frozen Delight is successfully designed, ensuring a visually delightful, user-friendly, and consistent brand experience.
